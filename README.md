# GalaxyBeta

Utilities for [Roblox Galaxy Beta](https://www.roblox.com/games/263135585/Galaxy-Beta?)

Loadstring:
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smallketchup82/GalaxyBeta/main/main.lua"))()`

The scripts apart from main.lua are modules, don't try to run them on their own or you'll most definitely face errors. Although the turret tp script should work since that was a different script which was integrated into this one.
